        <p n="1">
            <ln n="1"/>It won't be very long now
            <ln n="2"/>before we will all be together 
            <ln n="3"/>again on the <unclear reason="hard to read">Amida</unclear>. I am be-
            <ln n="4"/>ginning to feel more like I was
            <ln n="5"/>going home when we all live
            <ln n="6"/>on <unclear reason="hard to read">board</unclear> her than when in the 
            <ln n="7"/>house in <place>Erie</place>.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            <ln n="1"/> Please <unclear reason="unclear">dust</unclear> me a line some
            <ln n="2"/> time and tell me what arrange-
            <ln n="3"/> ments you made about
            <ln n="4"/> <unclear reason="hard to read">daring</unclear> the <unclear reason="hard to read">La Salle</unclear> meet
            <ln n="5"/> me in <place>Washington</place>. If
            <ln n="6"/> you haven't done this just say so
            <ln n="7"/> and I'll write <person id="MF">Miss <unclear reason="unclear name">Fraters</unclear></person>. I
            <ln n="8"/> shall probably write to her anyway as
            <ln n="9"/> I want to be sure the boot for
            <ln n="10"/> the toy is in the car and have
            <ln n="11"/> the wings put <crossOut/> back on again.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            <ln n="1"/> I haven't been able to get in
            <ln n="2"/> touch with <person id="BB">Betty Bratton</person> yet 
            <ln n="3"/> but I shall probably phone her
            <ln n="4"/> tonight if I can find out where
            <ln n="5"/> she lives. There is small informal
            <ln n="6"/> dance here next Saturday and
            <ln n="7"/> if she has no <unclear reason="hard to read">definite *</unclear> for
            <ln n="8"/> next <crossOut>december</crossOut> Christmas and might
            <ln n="9"/> be able to go I'll ask her <unclear reason="hard to read">if for</unclear>
            <ln n="10"/> that no that we can talk over that <!-- "no" might have meant "know" -->
            <ln n="11"/> matter. I think Harriet would like
            <ln n="12"/> it better if I could get someone to
            <ln n="13"/> * * keep her company. I'll <unclear reason="hard to read">write</unclear>
            <ln n="14"/> you to New York the * * the
            <ln n="15"/> phone call.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            <ln n="1"/> I'm not at all sure I'll have
            <ln n="2"/> I'll have time to make the enlargements you
            <ln n="3"/> want, but if I do I'll be glad to 
            <ln n="4"/> make them. Enlargements take a lot
            <ln n="5"/> of time and messing around.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            <ln n="1"/> There is not as much snow
            <ln n="2"/> here as there was in Erie, but
            <ln n="3"/> it <weather>very cold</weather>. The water question
            <ln n="4"/> is getting quite serious here now
            <ln n="5"/> and they are planning to drill a
            <ln n="6"/> number of wells next week. The
            <ln n="7"/> spring at the <place>Eaglehook</place> dried out
            <ln n="8"/> yesterday and so that <crossOut>is the jist</crossOut>
            <ln n="9"/> throws all the more drain on the
            <ln n="10"/> town system.
        </p>
        <p n="6">
            <ln n="1"/> Hope you have a nice <stain>t</stain>rip
            <ln n="2"/> south.
        </p>

            <ln n="1"/>Much love,
